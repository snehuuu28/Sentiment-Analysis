# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis Web App

This project is a web-based application for **Sentiment Analysis** using a pre-trained **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model and **TF-IDF** vectorization. It classifies the sentiment of a user-input sentence as **Positive** or **Negative**.

## 📌 What is Sentiment Analysis?

**Sentiment Analysis** is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether textual data expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. It has wide applications in areas like:

- Customer feedback analysis  
- Product reviews and ratings  
- Social media monitoring  
- Brand reputation management  

In this app, we perform binary classification to detect either **Positive** or **Negative** sentiment based on the input text.
